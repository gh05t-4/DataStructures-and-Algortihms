Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.


class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        max_profit, min_price = 0, float('inf')
        for price in prices:
            min_price = min(min_price, price)
            profit = price - min_price
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        return max_profit
